# Challenge2_ExcelVBA
This is my repository for Challenge 2 of the Data Analytics bootcamp - enjoy!

*Process*

  I used the class lecture materials to develop my VBA code for this challenge. All code is my own, and I did not borrow from web or other sources.
  For support, I consulted AI (namely, ChatGPT and Copilot) to help me debug errors and for clarity on how to format numbers and do column autofits.
  I also connected with my peer Bryan Carney before class to share my ideas on how to calculate Max/Min changes and Volume for the last portion of the exercise.
